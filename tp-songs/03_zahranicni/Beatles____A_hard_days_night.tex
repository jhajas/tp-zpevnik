It's been a \Ch{G}{hard} \Ch{C}{day}'s ni\Ch{G}{ght}, and I've been \Ch{F}{working} like a \Ch{G}{dog},

It's been a hard \Ch{C}{day}'s n\Ch{G}{ight}, I should be s\Ch{F}{leeping} like a\Ch{G}{ log},

But when I \Ch{C}{get} home to you, I find the t\Ch{D7}{hings} that you do,

Will make me f\Ch{G}{eel} \Ch{C}{al}\Ch{G}{right}.

You know I work all day, to get you money to buy you things,

And it's worth it just to hear you say, you're gonna give me everything.

So why on earth should I moan, 'cause when I get you alone,

You know I'll be okay.

When I'm \Ch{Hmi}{home}, \Ch{Emi}{everything} seems to be \Ch{Hmi}{right};

When I'm \Ch{G}{home}, \Ch{Emi}{feeling} you holding me \Ch{C}{tight}, \Ch{D}{tight}, yeah.

It's been a hard day's night, and I've been working like a dog,

It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log,

But when I get home to you, I find the things that you do,

Will make me feel all right,

You know I fee\Ch{C}{l} all\Ch{G}{ right},

You kno\Ch{G}{w} I f\Ch{C}{eel} \Ch{F}{all} right \Ch{G}{ }
