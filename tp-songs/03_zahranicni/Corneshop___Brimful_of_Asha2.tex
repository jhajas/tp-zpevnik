Theres dancin' behind movie scenes 

Behind the movie scenes, Sadi Rani 

She's the one that keeps the dream alive 

From the morning, past the evening 

Till the end of the light

Brimful of Asha on the 42 

Well its a brimful of Asha on the 42 

Brimful of Asha on the 42 

Well its a brimful of Asha on the 42

And singing, illuminate the main streets

And the cinema aisles 

We don't care about no government warnings 

Bout their promotion of a simple life 

And the dams they are building
