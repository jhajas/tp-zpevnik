\zs
An \Ch{F#}{old} \Ch{H}{man} \Ch{F#}{turned} ninety-\Ch{G#mi}{eight}.
He won the lottery and died the next day.

It's a black fly in your chardonnay.
It's a death row pardon two minutes to late

Isn't it \Ch{F#}{ironic}\Ch{H}{}? Don't you \Ch{F#}{think} \Ch{G#mi}{}

\zr
It's like \Ch{F#}{ra}\Ch{H}{in} on your \Ch{F#}{wedding} \Ch{G#mi}{day}.
It's a free \Ch{F#}{ri}\Ch{H}{de} when you've \Ch{F#}{already} \Ch{G#mi}{paid}.

it's the good ad\Ch{F#}{vi}\Ch{H}{ce} that you \Ch{F#}{just} didn't \Ch{G#mi}{take}

\Ch{A}{And} who would have \Ch{G#mi}{thought}... it \Ch{F#}{figures}

\zs
Mr. play-it-safe was afraid to fly

He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids good-bye

He waited his whole damn life just to take that flight

And as the plane crashed down he thought "well isn't this nice..."

And isn't it ironic... Don't you think?

Well \Ch{H}{life} has a funny way of sneaking \Ch{F#}{up} on you

When you think everything is okay and \Ch{G#mi}{everything's} Going right

And \Ch{H}{life} has a funny way of helping \Ch{F#}{you} out when

you think everything's gone wrong and \Ch{G#mi}{everything} blows up in your face
\ks

\zs
A traffic jam when you are already late

A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break

It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife

It's like meeting the man of my dreams then meeting his Beautiful wife

And isn't it ironic?Don't you think?A little too ir. .And yeah I really do think.
