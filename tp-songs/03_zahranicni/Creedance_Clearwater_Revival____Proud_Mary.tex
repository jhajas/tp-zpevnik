\Ch{D}{Left} a good job in the city,

workin for the man every night and day

and I never lost one minute of sleepin',

worryin' 'bout the way things might have been.

\Ch{A}{Big} wheels keep on turnin',

\Ch{Hmi}{Pro}ud  Mary keep on \Ch{G}{burnin'},

/: \Ch{D}{roll}-in, rollin, rollin on the river. :/

{Cleaned} a lot of plates in Memphis,

pumped a lot of pain down in New

Orleans,  But I never saw the good side of the city,

till I hitched a ride \Ch{A}{on} a river boat queen.

\Ch{D}{if} you come down to the river,

bet you're gonna find some people who live,

you don't have to worry, cause you have no money,

people on the river are \Ch{A}{happy} to give.
